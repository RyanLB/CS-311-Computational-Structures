### Practice Midterm Available

If you're looking for an example of the sorts of questions you can expect on Thursday's midterm, a
short practice test is available [here]({{ site.github.url }}{{ "Practice Midterm.pdf" | uri_encode}}).

Solutions should be uploaded tonight or tomorrow.

### Lecture 07 Notes Updated

In the original version, the proof that 0<sup>n</sup>1<sup>n</sup>0<sup>n</sup> was not context-free was missing a case. This has
now been rectified.

If you downloaded the notes to study, be sure to pull down a fresh copy.

### Welcome to CS 311.

This site is very much a work in progress. Expect it to get both prettier and more functional over
the first week or two.

Announcements should show up on this home page when I have something important to say. Until then,
have a look at the syllabus and the tentative schedule.
